        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Butter 
                two 20cm sandwich tins and line with non-stick 
                baking paper.</li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat 200g caster sugar, 200g 
                softened butter, 4 beaten eggs, 200g 
                self-raising flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 
                2 tbsp milk together until you have a smooth, 
                soft batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth 
                the surface with a spatula or the back of a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for about 20 mins until golden and the cake 
                springs back when pressed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the filling, beat the 100g softened 
                butter until smooth and creamy, then gradually 
                beat in 140g sifted icing sugar and a drop of 
                vanilla extract (if youre using it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the buttercream over the bottom of 
                one of the sponges. Top it with 170g 
                strawberry jam and sandwich the second 
                sponge on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. 
                Keep in an airtight container and eat within 
                2 days.
